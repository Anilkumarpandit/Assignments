    "Seaborn is a powerful Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Here are five plots commonly used in Seaborn along with their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scatter Plot (sns.scatterplot):\n",
    "Uses: Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. They help in identifying patterns, clusters, and outliers in the data. Seaborn enhances scatter plots with options for color, size, and style, making it easy to explore complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Histogram (sns.histplot):\n",
    "Uses: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable. They help in understanding the central tendency, dispersion, and skewness of the data. Seaborn provides options for adjusting bin size, adding kernel density estimation (KDE), and visualizing multiple distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bar Plot (sns.barplot):\n",
    "Uses: Bar plots are used to visualize the relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable. They help in comparing the mean or aggregate values of different categories. Seaborn allows grouping data by one or more categorical variables and automatically computes confidence intervals to provide insights into uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Box Plot (sns.boxplot):\n",
    "Uses: Box plots (box-and-whisker plots) are used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories. They display summary statistics such as median, quartiles, and potential outliers. Seaborn enhances box plots with options for grouping data, adding annotations, and adjusting aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Heatmap (sns.heatmap):\n",
    "Uses: Heatmaps are used to visualize the correlation or relationships between variables in a dataset. They represent data in a grid where each cell's color intensity represents the value of the variable. Heatmaps are useful for identifying patterns, clusters, and trends in large datasets. Seaborn provides options for customizing color palettes, annotations, and clustering.\n",

    "To accomplish this task, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Load the \"fmri\" dataset using the load_dataset() function from Seaborn.\n",
    "3. Plot a line plot using the \"timepoint\" on the x-axis and \"signal\" on the y-axis, while using different colors or styles for different events and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code to achieve that:\n",
