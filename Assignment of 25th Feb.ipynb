    "\n",
    "new_df.loc[2]: This will try to locate the row with index label '2' in the DataFrame new_df. Since the DataFrame is reindexed, 2 doesn't exist as an index label in the reindexed DataFrame, so it will return a KeyError.\n",

    "new_df.iloc[2]: This will try to locate the row at integer position 2 (which corresponds to the third row) in the DataFrame new_df.

    "In Pandas, window functions are used to perform calculations over a specified window of data, which can be a moving window or a fixed-size window. These functions allow you to compute metrics like rolling mean, rolling sum, rolling standard deviation, etc., over a defined window of data points.\n",

    "1. Rolling Window Functions: Rolling window functions compute a statistic over a specified window of data points that moves along the data. The window can be defined by a number of observations or a time period. Common rolling window functions include:\n",

    "rolling_corr(): Computes the rolling correlation between two series.\n",
    "rolling_cov(): Computes the rolling covariance between two series.\n",
    "rolling_max(), rolling_min(): Compute the rolling maximum and minimum values, respectively.\n",
