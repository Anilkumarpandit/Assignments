    "Testing Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing set is a subset of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It contains input data but does not include corresponding output labels. Instead, the model's predictions on the testing set are compared with the true labels to assess its accuracy and generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "Importance: The testing set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance and its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. It helps identify overfitting (when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data) and guides model selection and tuning.\n",
    "Validation Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation set is an additional subset of the dataset used to fine-tune model hyperparameters and select the best-performing model configuration. It is similar to the testing set but is used during the model development and tuning process, rather than for final evaluation.\n",
    "Importance: The validation set helps prevent overfitting by providing an independent dataset for model evaluation during the development phase. It allows researchers and practitioners to adjust model parameters and algorithms based on performance metrics without biasing the final evaluation on the testing set.\n",
    "The importance of each split can be summarized as follows:\n",

    "Testing Set: Used to evaluate the model's performance and assess its generalization to new data.\n",
