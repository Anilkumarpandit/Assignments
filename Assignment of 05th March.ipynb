    "1. Import necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Prepare your data.\n",
    "3. Create a figure using Bokeh's figure() function.\n",
    "4. Add glyphs (such as lines, circles, or patches) to the figure to represent your data.\n",
    "5. Customize the plot by adding titles, axis labels, legends, etc.\n",
    "6. Show or save the plot.\n",

    "In Bokeh, glyphs are visual shapes or markers that represent your data on a plot. They can be points, lines, patches, bars, or other geometric shapes. Glyphs are added to a Bokeh plot using glyph methods provided by the figure() object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how you can add glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Figure: First, you create a figure object using the figure() function from the bokeh.plotting module. This figure serves as the canvas on which you'll add your glyphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Glyphs: After creating the figure, you add glyphs to it using glyph methods such as line(), circle(), square(), triangle(), rect(), etc. Each glyph method takes data and additional parameters to specify how the glyph should appear on the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customize Glyph Appearance: You can customize the appearance of glyphs by providing attributes such as line color, fill color, line width, size, transparency, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show or Save the Plot: Finally, you display the plot using the show() function to render it in the browser or save it to a file using save().\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating how to add glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",

    "We can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend, by setting various attributes and properties of the figure and its components. Here's how you can customize different aspects of a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Figure Attributes: You can customize the overall appearance of the figure using attributes such as title, x_axis_label, y_axis_label, plot_width, plot_height, background_fill_color, border_fill_color, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Axes Properties: You can customize the appearance of the x-axis and y-axis by setting properties such as axis labels, axis line color, axis line width, tick labels, tick color, tick width, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Legend: You can add a legend to your plot and customize its appearance using attributes such as legend.location to specify the position (e.g., 'top_left', 'bottom_right'), legend.title to set the legend title, legend.label_text_font_size to adjust the font size of legend labels, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Title: You can set the title of the plot using the title attribute of the figure object.\n",

    "A Bokeh server is a Python process that allows you to create and deploy interactive Bokeh plots and applications. Bokeh server enables you to build dynamic, interactive web applications with rich, interactive visualizations that can be updated in real time based on user interactions, data updates, or periodic callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a Bokeh server works and how we can use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building Interactive Plots: You can create interactive Bokeh plots using Python code just like you would for static plots. Bokeh provides a high-level interface for creating interactive visualizations with tools such as hover tooltips, pan, zoom, selection, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interactivity: Bokeh allows you to add interactivity to your plots by attaching JavaScript callbacks to user interactions such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, selections, etc. These callbacks can trigger updates to the plot's data, attributes, or other visual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bokeh Server: With Bokeh server, you can deploy your Bokeh plots and applications as web applications that run on a Python server. The Bokeh server provides a scalable and efficient way to serve interactive plots and applications to multiple users simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real-Time Updates: Bokeh server supports real-time updates to plots and applications by enabling bi-directional communication between the web browser and the server. You can update the plot data, attributes, or layout in response to user interactions, changes in data sources, or periodic events.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Widgets and Controls: Bokeh server allows you to incorporate interactive widgets and controls into your plots and applications. These widgets enable users to interactively control the behavior and appearance of the plots, such as selecting data subsets, adjusting parameters, filtering data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deploying Bokeh Server Applications: You can deploy Bokeh server applications on a web server or cloud platform, making them accessible to users over the internet. Bokeh server applications can be embedded in web pages or served as standalone applications with their own URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example demonstrating how to use Bokeh server to create a simple interactive plot with real-time updates:\n",
