    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It is widely used for generating plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatterplots, etc. Matplotlib is highly customizable and integrates well with other libraries like NumPy and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Matplotlib used?\n",
    "Matplotlib is used for various purposes, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization: Matplotlib provides a convenient interface for creating a wide range of high-quality plots, which is essential for data analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publication-quality Graphics: It allows users to generate publication-quality graphics for scientific publications, presentations, and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: Matplotlib offers extensive customization options for fine-tuning plots according to specific requirements, including colors, line styles, labels, annotations, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration: It integrates seamlessly with other libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and SciPy, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform Compatibility: Matplotlib supports various operating systems and graphical backends, ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib:\n",
    "Line Plot: A basic plot used to visualize the relationship between two variables by connecting data points with straight lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plot: A plot used to visualize the relationship between two variables by displaying individual data points on a two-dimensional plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram: A graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data, where data is divided into bins and the frequency of occurrences in each bin is plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar Chart: A chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars whose lengths are proportional to the values they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie Chart: A circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. The size of each slice represents the proportion of each category relative to the whole.\n",

    "A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays the relationship between two variables by representing individual data points on a two-dimensional plane. Each point on the plot represents an observation in the dataset, where one variable is plotted along the x-axis and the other variable is plotted along the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scatter plot, the position of each point corresponds to the values of the two variables. It is useful for visualizing the correlation or relationship between the variables, identifying patterns, and detecting outliers.\n",

    "A bar plot is a type of plot that represents categorical data with rectangular bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. Bar plots are commonly used to compare the values of different categories or to show the distribution of categorical data.\n",

    "Comparison: Bar plots are used to compare the values of different categories easily.\n",
    "Visual Representation: They provide a clear and visual representation of categorical data, making it easier to interpret and understand.\n",
    "Distribution: Bar plots can also be used to show the distribution of categorical data across different categories.\n",
