    "    GET and POST are two of the most commonly used HTTP methods, used to request and send data between clients (such as web \n",
    "    browsers) and servers (such as web servers). These methods serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. GET Method:\n",
    "    he GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. When a client sends a GET request, it asks the server to provide a \n",
    "    resource (usually a web page, an image, a file, etc.). The data is typically appended to the URL as query parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Key characteristics of the GET method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Requests are visible in the URL's query parameters.\n",
    "    - Data is limited in size due to URL length constraints.\n",
    "    - The request can be cached by the browser.\n",
    "    - Generally, GET requests are considered safe and idempotent, meaning they should not change the server's state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. POST Method:\n",
    "    The POST method is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. It's commonly used when submitting forms \n",
    "    on websites, sending data to APIs, and other scenarios where data needs to be sent to the server for processing or storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Key characteristics of the POST method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Requests are not visible in the URL; data is sent in the request body.\n",
    "    - Data size is not limited by URL length constraints.\n",
    "    - The request is not cached by default.\n",
    "    - POST requests can change the server's state, such as adding new data to a database.\n",

    "    In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming request data when handling HTTP requests. It provides a way to \n",
    "    access various components of an HTTP request, such as form data, query parameters, headers, cookies, and more. The request\n",
    "    object allows you to extract and work with the data sent by a client in the context of a specific HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some common scenarios where the request object is used in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Accessing Form Data:\n",
    "    When a client submits a form in an HTML template, the request object can be used to access the form data sent by the \n",
    "    client. This is commonly used in web applications to handle user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Query Parameters:\n",
    "    The request object can be used to retrieve query parameters from the URL. This is useful for extracting data from URLs, \n",
    "    such as when implementing pagination or filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Headers:\n",
    "    We can access various HTTP headers sent by the client using the request object. This is often used to retrieve information\n",
    "    about the client's browser, user agent, or authentication headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv. Cookies:\n",
    "    Cookies sent by the client can be accessed using the request object. This allows you to implement features like user \n",
    "    sessions and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "    v. File Uploads:\n",
    "    If a client is uploading files, the request object can be used to handle and process the uploaded files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vi. Request Methods:\n",
    "    The request object provides information about the HTTP method used in the request, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.\n",

    "    In Flask, the redirect() function is used to perform a redirection to a different URL. It's commonly used when you want to\n",
    "    send the user to a different route or page within your application after processing a form submission, authentication, or\n",
    "    any other action that requires a redirection. This function is particularly useful for implementing the Post/Redirect/Get \n",
    "    (PRG) pattern, which helps prevent form resubmission when users refresh the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's why the redirect() function is used in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Preventing Form Resubmission:\n",
    "    When a user submits a form, and the server responds with a normal HTML response, refreshing the page might result in the \n",
    "    browser resubmitting the form data. This can lead to unintended duplicate submissions. By using the redirect() function, \n",
    "    we can redirect the user to a different route after processing the form, effectively preventing form resubmission when the\n",
    "    user refreshes the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Cleaner URL Handling:\n",
    "    The redirect() function allows you to guide users to a clean URL after processing actions. For example, after successful\n",
    "    login or registration, you can redirect users to their profile page or a dashboard route.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Navigation After Processing:\n",
    "    After performing an action that requires a user to be redirected, such as logging in or submitting a form, the redirect() \n",
    "    function allows us to guide the user to an appropriate route for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv. Changing URL Structure:\n",
    "    If we decide to change the URL structure of your application or modify the naming of routes, the redirect() function allows\n",
    "    us to maintain compatibility by updating the redirects accordingly.\n",

    "    In Flask, templates are used to generate dynamic HTML content that can be displayed to users. Templates allow you to \n",
    "    separate the presentation layer (HTML) from the application logic (Python code) in your Flask application. This separation\n",
    "    of concerns makes your code more organized, maintainable, and allows for reusability of code snippets across different \n",
    "    pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Templates in Flask are typically written using a templating engine, such as Jinja2, which is integrated into Flask. Jinja2\n",
    "    allows you to insert dynamic data into HTML templates, perform loops and conditionals, and include reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The render_template() function in Flask is used to render a template and generate the final HTML page to be sent to the \n",
    "    client's browser. This function takes the name of the template file and any required data as arguments. It then combines \n",
    "    the template with the provided data to produce the final HTML output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's say you have a Flask application with a route that displays a user's profile information using a template:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "    app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "    @app.route('/profile/<username>')\n",
    "    def profile(username):\n",
    "        user_info = {\n",
    "            'username': username,\n",
    "            'age': 25,\n",
    "            'location': 'New York'\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return render_template('profile.html', user=user_info)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        app.run()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    -> In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The profile() route function receives a username parameter from the URL.\n",
    "    - Inside the route, a dictionary named user_info is created, containing user-specific information.\n",
    "    - The render_template() function is used to render the profile.html template. The user argument provides the template with\n",
    "      the user_info dictionary, which can be used to populate the HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
