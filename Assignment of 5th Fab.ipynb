    "\tClass- A class is a user-defined blueprint ot prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data\n",
    "\tand functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.\n",
    "\tEach class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined\n",
    "\tby their class) for modifying their state.\n",

    "\tObject- An object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual\n",

    "\tAll classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",
    "\tWe use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when\n",

    "\tThe self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. It works as a\n",

    "\tInheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits\n",
