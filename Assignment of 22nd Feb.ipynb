    "In Pandas, both DataFrame and Series are fundamental data structures used for handling data, but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame:\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a spreadsheet or a SQL table.\n",
    "It is a collection of Series that share the same index.\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Capable of handling data of different types and sizes.\n",
    "Columns can be of different data types.\n",
    "It has both row and column indices, making it versatile for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n",
    "        'Age': [25, 30, 35],\n",
    "        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 5:\n",
    "       \n",
    "Pandas offers a wide range of functions for data manipulation within a DataFrame. Some common functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "head() and tail(): These functions allow you to view the first or last few rows of the DataFrame, respectively. They are useful for quickly inspecting the structure of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types, non-null values, and memory usage. It's helpful for understanding the overall structure and composition of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "describe(): Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. shape: Returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame (number of rows, number of columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. loc[] and iloc[]: Used for indexing and selecting data. loc[] is label-based, meaning you can use column names and row labels, while iloc[] is integer-based, allowing you to access data using integer indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. dropna(): Drops rows or columns with missing values (NaNs). It helps in cleaning the dataset by removing incomplete or inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. fillna(): Fills missing values in the DataFrame with specified values. This function is useful for handling missing data by imputing values based on certain strategies like mean, median, or mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. groupby(): Groups the DataFrame by one or more columns and allows applying aggregate functions (e.g., sum, mean, count) on the grouped data. It's handy for performing group-wise analysis and computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. sort_values(): Sorts the DataFrame by specified column(s) in ascending or descending order. It's useful for arranging data in a desired order for analysis or presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. merge(), join(), and concat(): These functions are used to combine multiple DataFrames either by row or column-wise. They are essential for data integration and combining information from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a DataFrame named sales_data containing sales records with columns like 'Date', 'Product', 'Quantity', and 'Price'. You might use functions like head(), info(), and describe() to quickly inspect the structure and summary statistics of your data, ensuring that it's clean and suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming sales_data is your DataFrame\n",
    "# View the first few rows\n",
    "print(sales_data.head())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get concise summary of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(sales_data.info())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns\n",
    "print(sales_data.describe())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 6:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Among Series, DataFrame, and Panel, DataFrame is mutable in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series: Series is immutable in nature. Once created, you cannot modify the elements of a Series. You can, however, create a new Series with modified values based on the original Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame: DataFrame is mutable. You can modify the contents of a DataFrame by adding or removing rows or columns, updating values, or performing various operations to transform the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel: Panels are generally considered deprecated in recent versions of Pandas. They were 3-dimensional data structures (akin to a DataFrame with an added dimension), but they have been phased out in favor of other data structures. However, if we consider Panels, they were mutable like DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the correct answer is: DataFrame is mutable in nature.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 7:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating multiple Series\n",
    "name_series = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])\n",
    "age_series = pd.Series([25, 30, 35])\n",
    "city_series = pd.Series(['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame using the Series\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Name': name_series,\n",
    "    'Age': age_series,\n",
    "    'City': city_series\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have created three Series: name_series, age_series, and city_series. Each Series contains data for names, ages, and cities, respectively, of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then created a dictionary data where the keys are the column names ('Name', 'Age', 'City') and the values are the corresponding Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used the pd.DataFrame() constructor to create a DataFrame df using the dictionary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting DataFrame has three columns ('Name', 'Age', 'City') and three rows, where each row corresponds to the values from the respective Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
