    "    \n",
    "    Using the Exception class as the base class when creating a custom exception in Python is a recommended practice because\n",
    "    it ensures that your custom exception behaves like a standard exception class and inherits all the necessary properties \n",
    "    and behaviors required for consistent and proper error handling. The Exception class provides a well-defined structure\n",
    "    and functionality that custom exceptions should adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are a few reasons why using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Consistency and Compatibility: By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception maintains compatibility \n",
    "    with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python. This consistency makes it easier for other developers to \n",
    "    understand how to handle your custom exception and how it fits into the broader exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Standard Attributes and Methods: The Exception class provides standard attributes and methods that facilitate \n",
    "    consistent error handling. These include attributes like args (arguments passed to the exception), message (the error \n",
    "    message), and methods like __str__ (to generate a string representation of the exception). By inheriting from Exception,\n",
    "    your custom exception inherits these attributes and methods, ensuring a standardized behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Clearer Intention: When you create a custom exception using Exception as the base class, it's immediately clear that \n",
    "    your class is meant to represent an exception. This clarity enhances the readability of your code and helps other \n",
    "    developers understand your intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv. Compatibility with except Clauses: When you create a custom exception using Exception as the base class, it can be \n",
    "    caught by except clauses that catch generic exceptions. This means your custom exception can be handled alongside built-in\n",
    "    exceptions, simplifying error handling in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example that demonstrates creating a custom exception by inheriting from the Exception class:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception inheriting from the Exception class.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "            super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        raise CustomError(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "    except CustomError as ce:\n",
    "        print(\"Caught custom exception:\", ce)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    In this example, the CustomError class inherits from the Exception class. It uses the standard __init__ method from the \n",
    "    Exception class to set the error message. When the exception is raised and caught, it behaves similarly to built-in \n",
    "    exceptions in terms of error handling and attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "    By inheriting from the Exception class, you ensure that your custom exception follows best practices for error handling \n",
    "    and seamlessly integrates with Python's exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",

    "Answer 2:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "        print(\" \" * indent, exception_class.__name__)\n",
    "        for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "            print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "    print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    When we run this program, it will print the hierarchy of exception classes starting from BaseException. The indentation \n",
    "    indicates the depth of the hierarchy. Note that the actual hierarchy is quite extensive, so the output may be lengthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keep in mind that the BaseException class is the root of the exception hierarchy, and it's subclassed by various other \n",
    "    exception classes, such as Exception, ArithmeticError, LookupError, and many more. The program above recursively traverses\n",
    "    the exception hierarchy and prints each exception class along with its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remember to execute the code in a Python environment to see the complete hierarchy. Due to the extensive nature of the \n",
    "    hierarchy, the output may span multiple screens.\n",

    "    The ArithmeticError class in Python is the base class for exceptions related to arithmetic operations. It provides a \n",
    "    common base for more specific arithmetic-related exception classes. Two commonly used exceptions that are subclasses of \n",
    "    ArithmeticError are ZeroDivisionError and OverflowError.\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    This exception is raised when attempting to divide a number by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0\n",

    "    \n",
    "    ii. OverflowError:\n",
    "    This exception is raised when an arithmetic operation exceeds the limits of the data type, causing an overflow.\n",

    "    Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        large_number = 10**1000\n",
    "        result = large_number * large_number\n",

    "    \n",
    "    The LookupError class in Python is the base class for exceptions that are raised when an index or a key cannot be found \n",
    "    in a sequence, mapping, or container. It provides a common base for more specific exceptions like IndexError and KeyError.\n",
    "    The purpose of using LookupError is to catch these specific lookup-related errors in a more generalized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are two common exceptions that are subclasses of LookupError:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. KeyError:\n",
    "    This exception is raised when trying to access a dictionary using a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        value = my_dict['c']\n",

    "    Error: 'c'\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. IndexError:\n",
    "    This exception is raised when trying to access an index in a sequence (like a list or a string) that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",

    "    Both ImportError and ModuleNotFoundError are exceptions related to importing modules in Python. They occur when there are\n",
    "    issues with importing and using external modules in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. ImportError:\n",
    "    ImportError is a base exception class that is raised when an import statement cannot find the module you're trying to\n",
    "    import or when there are issues within the module you're trying to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Let's say you have a file named my_module.py with the following code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # my_module.py\n",
    "    def say_hello():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from my_module!\")\n",
    "        \n",

    "Answet 6:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Exception handling is an important aspect of writing robust and reliable Python code. Here are some best practices to \n",
    "    follow when dealing with exception handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Be Specific in Exception Handling:\n",
    "    Catch only the exceptions that you expect and can handle. Avoid catching generic exceptions like Exception or \n",
    "    BaseException unless you have a good reason to do so. Catching specific exceptions makes your code more readable and \n",
    "    prevents unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Use Multiple except Blocks:\n",
    "    When handling multiple exception types, use separate except blocks for each. This allows you to provide different \n",
    "    error-handling strategies for different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Avoid Empty except Blocks:\n",
    "    Avoid using empty except blocks, as they can hide errors and make debugging difficult. If you catch an exception, log or \n",
    "    display relevant information about the error to aid in troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv. Use else Block Sparingly:\n",
    "    Use the else block after a try block when you want to execute code that should only run if no exceptions occurred.\n",
    "    However, don't use it for complex logic, as it might make the code harder to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    v. Use finally for Cleanup:\n",
    "    If you need to perform cleanup operations (closing files, releasing resources, etc.), use the finally block. It ensures \n",
    "    that the cleanup code runs regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vi. Avoid Deeply Nested try Blocks:\n",
    "    Avoid nesting too many try blocks, as it can make your code hard to read and understand. If you find yourself nesting \n",
    "    multiple try blocks, consider refactoring your code to simplify the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vii. Use Custom Exception Classes:\n",
    "    Define custom exception classes for specific error scenarios in your code. This makes error handling more informative and \n",
    "    enables consistent error reporting throughout your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "    viii. Handle Expected Exceptions:\n",
    "    Handle exceptions that you anticipate might occur due to external factors (like file I/O, network issues) to prevent \n",
    "    program crashes. Provide meaningful error messages to guide users and developers in understanding and resolving the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ix. Log Exceptions:\n",
    "    Use a logging framework like logging to record exceptions. This helps in diagnosing issues and understanding the flow of\n",
    "    your program in different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    x. Keep Error Messages User-Friendly:\n",
    "    When presenting error messages to users, keep them concise, clear, and user-friendly. Avoid exposing technical details that\n",
    "    users might not understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "    xi. Rethrow Exceptions Sparingly:\n",
    "    Rethrow exceptions only when you need to perform additional actions or cleanups but still want to propagate the exception.\n",
    "    Generally, it's better to handle exceptions where they occur rather than rethrowing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    xii. Use with Statements:\n",
    "    Use with statements for resources like file handling, database connections, etc. This ensures that resources are properly\n",
    "    managed, and exceptions are handled appropriately even if they occur within the with context.\n",
    "\n",
    "    By following these best practices, you can write clean, maintainable, and error-resilient code that handles exceptions \n",
    "    effectively and gracefully."
