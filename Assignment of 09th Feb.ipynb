    "    Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods \n",
    "    from more than one parent class. This allows a subclass to inherit behaviors and characteristics from multiple parent\n",
    "    classes. In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from two or more base classes, and it can have access to the \n",
    "    attributes and methods of all its parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of multiple inheritance in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Engine:\n",
    "        def start(self):\n",

    "    Getter and setter methods in Python are used to control the access and modification of class attributes (instance \n",
    "    variables). They provide a way to retrieve (get) and update (set) the values of private attributes while encapsulating\n",
    "    the internal implementation details. This helps in maintaining data integrity, applying validation, and providing a \n",
    "    controlled interface for interacting with class attributes.\n",

    "    Method overriding in Python occurs when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method that is already defined\n",
    "    in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass has the same name, parameters, and return type as the method\n",
    "    in the parent class. This allows the subclass to customize the behavior of the method while inheriting the general\n",
    "    structure from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example to demonstrate method overriding in Python:\n",
