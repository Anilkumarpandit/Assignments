    "Answer 1:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> MongoDB:\n",
    "       MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that is designed to handle unstructured or \n",
    "       semi-structured data. It falls under the category of non-relational databases and is known for its flexible and scalable \n",
    "       architecture. MongoDB stores data in a document-oriented format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for the storage of\n",
    "       complex data structures like arrays and nested documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "       Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular structure\n",
    "       of rows and columns found in relational databases. Instead, they use various data models to store and manage data, \n",
    "       including document-based, key-value, columnar, and graph-based models. Non-relational databases are designed to handle \n",
    "       large amounts of data with high speed and scalability, making them well-suited for modern applications that deal with \n",
    "       diverse and rapidly changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Scenarios Preferred for MongoDB over SQL Databases:\n",
    "       MongoDB is preferred over traditional SQL databases in several scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Flexible Schema: MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows you to store data without a fixed schema, making it \n",
    "         suitable for applications where the data model evolves frequently or where data is semistructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Complex Data: If your data includes nested arrays, subdocuments, or other complex structures, MongoDB's document \n",
    "         model can represent this data more naturally compared to SQL's rigid tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Scaling: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle\n",
    "         large amounts of data and high traffic. It can distribute data across multiple nodes or servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * High Write Throughput: If your application requires high-speed write operations, MongoDB's ability to handle rapid\n",
    "         insertions and updates can be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Real-time Analytics: MongoDB's ability to store and query large volumes of data in near real-time is well-suited for\n",
    "         applications that require fast and frequent data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Geospatial Data: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial indexing and queries, making it a good choice for \n",
    "         applications that involve location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Prototyping and Agile Development: MongoDB's flexibility and ease of use make it suitable for rapidly prototyping \n",
    "         applications or for projects with evolving requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Caching and Caching Layers: MongoDB can be used as a cache storage layer, especially when combined with in-memory \n",
    "         databases, to improve data retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your \n",
    "    application. While MongoDB offers advantages in terms of flexibility and scalability, SQL databases are well-suited for \n",
    "    applications that require strict data consistency, complex joins, and well-defined relationships between tables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer 2:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle \n",
    "    unstructured or semi-structured data. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Document-Oriented:\n",
    "    MongoDB stores data in a document-oriented format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for the storage of complex data\n",
    "    structures like arrays and nested documents. Each document is a self-contained unit that can represent a single record or \n",
    "    entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Schema Flexibility:\n",
    "    MongoDB offers a dynamic schema, allowing you to change the structure of documents without affecting other documents in the\n",
    "    collection. This is particularly useful when dealing with evolving data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * High Scalability:\n",
    "    MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, enabling you to distribute data across multiple servers or nodes. It\n",
    "    supports sharding, which allows for efficient distribution of data and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Automatic Sharding:\n",
    "    MongoDB's sharding architecture automatically distributes data across shards, making it easy to scale out as data volume \n",
    "    increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "    MongoDB supports dynamic queries and indexing on any field in the document. This flexibility enables powerful ad hoc\n",
    "    querying and allows you to retrieve data based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Rich Query Language:\n",
    "    MongoDB's query language supports a wide range of operators and expressions, making it suitable for complex data retrieval\n",
    "    and manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Aggregation Framework: \n",
    "    MongoDB provides an aggregation framework that allows you to perform advanced data analysis, transformations, and \n",
    "    computations directly within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Geospatial Indexing and Queries:\n",
    "    MongoDB supports geospatial data storage, indexing, and queries, making it ideal for location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * High Availability:\n",
    "    MongoDB offers features like replica sets, which provide automatic failover and data redundancy, ensuring high availability\n",
    "    and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Automatic Failover:\n",
    "    In a replica set, MongoDB can automatically detect when a primary node becomes unavailable and promote a secondary node to\n",
    "    primary, minimizing downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Flexible Replication:\n",
    "    MongoDB's replication feature enables you to create multiple copies of data across different servers for backup and disaster\n",
    "    recovery purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Capped Collections:\n",
    "    Capped collections in MongoDB maintain a fixed-size, high-performance collection that automatically overwrites older data\n",
    "    as new data is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * GridFS:\n",
    "    MongoDB's GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large binary files, such as images, videos, and audio files,\n",
    "    in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Security Features:\n",
    "    MongoDB provides features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to ensure data security and protect \n",
    "    sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * JSON-Like Documents:\n",
    "    BSON documents in MongoDB are represented in a JSON-like format, making it easy to work with for developers familiar with\n",
    "    JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "    These features make MongoDB a versatile and powerful choice for a wide range of applications, particularly those that\n",
    "    involve large volumes of diverse and rapidly changing data.\n",
    "    \n",

    "Answer 3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To connect to MongoDB from Python, you can use the pymongo library, which is the official MongoDB driver for Python. \n",
    "    Here's an example of how to connect to MongoDB, create a database, and create a collection within that database:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Connect to MongoDB server\n",
    "    client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create or access a database\n",
    "    mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create or access a collection\n",
    "    mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sample data to insert\n",
    "    data = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Insert data into the collection\n",
    "    insert_result = mycol.insert_one(data)\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Close the connection\n",
    "    client.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> Explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Import the pymongo library, which provides the tools to interact with MongoDB from Python.\n",

    "        - Create or access a collection named \"customers\" within the \"mydatabase\" using mydb[\"customers\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Define a sample data dictionary (data) to insert into the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Use the insert_one() method to insert the sample data into the collection. It returns an InsertOneResult object containing the inserted document's _id.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Fetch and print all documents in the collection using the find() method. This method returns a cursor, which you can iterate over to retrieve documents.\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "    In this code, we first insert one record using insert_one() and multiple records using insert_many(). Then, we retrieve\n",
    "    and print the inserted record using find_one() and all inserted records using find(). Remember that the _id field is \n",
    "    automatically generated by MongoDB when inserting documents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 5:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The find() method in MongoDB is used to query a collection and retrieve documents that match specified criteria. It returns\n",
    "    a cursor, which allows you to iterate through the results and access the documents one by one. You can apply various \n",
    "    filtering conditions, sorting, and projection to control which documents are returned by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's how you can use the find() method to query a MongoDB database:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Connect to MongoDB server\n",
    "    client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Access the created database and collection\n",
    "    mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "    mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Find documents that match a specific condition\n",
    "    query = {\"city\": \"London\"}\n",
    "    result = mycol.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the retrieved documents\n",
    "    print(\"Documents matching the query:\")\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Close the connection\n",
    "    client.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> In this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We connect to the MongoDB server and access the database and collection as before.\n",
    "    - We define a query dictionary with the condition that documents should have the \"city\" field equal to \"London\".\n",
    "    - We use the find() method with the query as an argument to retrieve documents that match the specified condition.\n",
    "    - We loop through the cursor result and print each retrieved document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The find() method is flexible and allows you to use various operators and conditions to filter and retrieve specific \n",
    "    documents from the collection. You can also use other methods like sort(), limit(), and projection to further control the \n",
    "    behavior of the query results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 6:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The sort() method in MongoDB is used to specify the order in which the query results should be returned. You can use the\n",
    "    sort() method to sort documents based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order. This is particularly useful \n",
    "    when you want to present data in a specific order, such as alphabetical, numerical, or chronological.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "    collection.find(query, sort_field, sort_order)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * query: The query document that specifies the filtering conditions for the search.\n",
    "    * sort_field: The field by which the sorting should be done.\n",
    "    * sort_order: The sorting order. Use 1 for ascending order and -1 for descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider a collection named \"books\" with documents representing books' information. Let's sort the books by their\n",
    "    publication year in ascending order:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Connect to MongoDB server\n",
    "    client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Access the database and collection\n",
    "    db = client[\"library\"]\n",

    "    # Define the query (none in this case, to retrieve all documents)\n",
    "    query = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sort by publication year in ascending order\n",
    "    sort_field = \"publication_year\"\n",
    "    sort_order = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Execute the query with sorting\n",
    "    result_cursor = collection.find(query).sort(sort_field, sort_order)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Close the connection\n",
    "    client.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We connect to the MongoDB server and access the \"library\" database and \"books\" collection.\n",

    "    - We specify the field \"publication_year\" as the sorting field and use sort_order = 1 for ascending order.\n",
    "    - We use the sort() method in conjunction with the find() method to execute the query with sorting.\n",
    "    - We loop through the cursor result_cursor and print each sorted book document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can modify the sort_field and sort_order variables to sort by different fields or in different orders according to our\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 7:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In MongoDB, the delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() methods are used to remove documents and collections from a\n",
    "    database. Each method serves a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. delete_one() Method:\n",
    "    The delete_one() method is used to delete a single document that matches a specific query. If multiple documents match the\n",
    "    query, only the first one encountered will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "    collection.delete_one(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    result = collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "    print(\"Deleted document count:\", result.deleted_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. delete_many() Method:\n",
    "    The delete_many() method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specific query. It removes all documents that\n",
    "    meet the criteria specified in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "    collection.delete_many(query)\n",

    "    result = collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$lt\": 25}})\n",
    "    print(\"Deleted document count:\", result.deleted_count)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii. drop() Method:\n",
    "    The drop() method is used to delete an entire collection from the database. Unlike the other methods, it doesn't take a \n",
    "    query as an argument; it directly deletes the collection.\n",
