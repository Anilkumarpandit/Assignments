    "Answer 1:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and \n",
    "    management. Databases are used to store and manage various types of information, such as text, numbers, images, and more.\n",
    "    They provide mechanisms for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data, as well as for ensuring data integrity and\n",
    "    security.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two main categories of databases: SQL (relational databases) and NoSQL (non-relational databases). Here's a \n",
    "    differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "    * SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are also known as relational databases.\n",
    "    * Data in SQL databases is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Each table has rows representing individual \n",
    "      records and columns representing attributes of those records.\n",
    "    * SQL databases follow a rigid structure, where data needs to be normalized to minimize data redundancy and maintain \n",
    "      consistency.\n",
    "    * They use SQL as the standard query language for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "    * ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are typically supported, ensuring data integrity and \n",
    "      reliability.\n",
    "    * Popular SQL database systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases encompass a variety of database types, including document-based, key-value, columnar, and graph \n",
    "      databases.\n",
    "    * Data in NoSQL databases can be stored in flexible formats such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs, without adhering to a \n",
    "      fixed schema.\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for rapidly changing \n",
    "      data models.\n",
    "    * They use different query languages and approaches depending on the database type. Examples include MongoDB (document-based),\n",
    "      Cassandra (columnar), and Redis (key-value).\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases often focus on horizontal scalability and high availability, making them suitable for distributed and cloud-based\n",
    "      environments.\n",
    "    * ACID properties may not be strictly adhered to in all NoSQL databases, as some prioritize other aspects like high performance \n",
    "      and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Key Differences:\n",
    "        - Data Model: SQL databases have a rigid, predefined schema with structured tables, while NoSQL databases allow more \n",
    "          flexible and dynamic data models.\n",
    "        - Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulation, while NoSQL databases use various \n",
    "          query languages or APIs specific to their type.\n",
    "        - Data Consistency: SQL databases prioritize strong data consistency and ACID properties, while NoSQL databases might \n",
    "          trade strict consistency for higher availability and performance.\n",
    "        - Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability and distributed architectures, making them \n",
    "          more suitable for large-scale applications.\n",
    "        - Use Cases: SQL databases are typically used for applications with well-defined data structures and complex relationships.\n",
    "          NoSQL databases are used for applications with dynamic or rapidly changing data, high-speed read/write requirements,\n",
    "          and distributed setups.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    DDL stands for \"Data Definition Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and \n",
    "    managing the structure of database objects. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database\n",
    "    objects such as tables, indexes, constraints, and views. DDL statements do not manipulate data itself; they focus on the \n",
    "    organization and structure of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some common DDL statements and their explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. CREATE:\n",
    "    The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Creating a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "        LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "        Age INT\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. DROP:\n",
    "    The DROP statement is used to delete database objects like tables, indexes, or views. It permanently removes the object \n",
    "    and its data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Dropping a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii. ALTER:\n",
    "    The ALTER statement is used to modify existing database objects. You can use it to add, modify, or delete columns, \n",
    "    constraints, or other properties of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Adding a Column to a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "    ADD Email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    iv. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "    The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively deleting all data while keeping the table \n",
    "    structure intact. Unlike the DROP statement, TRUNCATE doesn't remove the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Truncating a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",

    "    DML stands for \"Data Manipulation Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data\n",
    "    stored in a database. DML statements are responsible for adding, modifying, and deleting data in database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some common DML statements and their explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. INSERT:\n",
    "    The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It allows you to specify the values for each column you\n",
    "    want to populate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Inserting Data into a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age)\n",
    "    VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 30);\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. UPDATE:\n",
    "    The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It allows you to change the values of specific columns in\n",
    "    one or more rows based on specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Updating Data in a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    UPDATE Employees\n",
    "    SET Age = 31\n",
    "    WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii. DELETE:\n",
    "    The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows of data from a table. It allows you to specify conditions to \n",
    "    determine which rows to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Deleting Data from a Table:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",

    "    DQL stands for \"Data Query Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for querying and retrieving\n",
    "    data from a database. DQL is primarily focused on retrieving information stored in database tables without making changes\n",
    "    to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most common DQL statement is the SELECT statement, which allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and\n",
    "    apply filtering conditions to fetch specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. SELECT:\n",
    "    The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. It allows you to specify the columns you want to \n",
    "    retrieve and define conditions for filtering the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - Retrieving Data from a Table: \n",
    "        \n",
    "    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE Age > 25;\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the SELECT statement retrieves data from the Employees table. It specifies that you want to retrieve the\n",
    "    FirstName, LastName, and Age columns. Additionally, the WHERE clause filters the results to only include rows where the \n",
    "    Age is greater than 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The result of this query would be a list of employees' first names, last names, and ages, where the age is greater than 25.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can also use aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., to perform calculations on the selected data and retrieve \n",
    "    summarized information.\n",

    "Answer 5:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i. Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It \n",
    "    ensures that every record in the table has a distinct and non-null identifier. Primary keys play a crucial role in \n",
    "    maintaining data integrity, enforcing entity uniqueness, and establishing relationships between tables. They are used as a\n",
    "    reference point for linking records in related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column(s) must be unique, meaning no two rows can have the same value.\n",
    "    * Non-null: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null (empty) values. Each row must have a value in the primary key \n",
    "      column(s).\n",
    "    * Stability: The values in the primary key column(s) should not change frequently. Changing primary key values can cause \n",
    "      complications in maintaining data integrity and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Consider a table named \"Students\" with columns \"StudentID\" (primary key), \"FirstName,\" and \"LastName.\" The \"StudentID\" \n",
    "    uniquely identifies each student, ensuring that no two students have the same ID. This allows for easy retrieval of \n",
    "    specific student records and linking them with other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. The foreign \n",
    "    key in one table references the primary key in another table. This creates a relationship between the two tables, allowing\n",
    "    you to maintain data consistency and integrity while establishing connections between related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * References Primary Key: The foreign key column(s) in one table references the primary key column(s) in another table.\n",
    "    * Maintains Referential Integrity: Foreign keys ensure that values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to valid values\n",
    "      in the referenced primary key column(s).\n",
    "    * Enforces Relationships: Foreign keys enforce relationships between tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or \n",
    "      many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Continuing with the \"Students\" table example, imagine another table named \"Courses\" with columns \"CourseID\" (primary key),\n",
    "    \"CourseName,\" and \"Instructor.\" If you want to link students to the courses they are enrolled in, you can create a foreign \n",
    "    key \"StudentID\" in the \"Courses\" table that references the \"StudentID\" primary key in the \"Students\" table. This way, you \n",
    "    can track which students are enrolled in which courses.\n",

    "Answer 6:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To connect to a MySQL database from Python, you can use the mysql.connector library, which provides a straightforward way\n",
    "    to interact with MySQL databases. Here's a simple example of how to connect to a MySQL database using this library and how\n",
    "    to use the cursor() and execute() methods:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a connection to the MySQL database\n",
    "    db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "        host=\"localhost\",    # Your database host\n",
    "        user=\"username\",     # Your database username\n",
    "        password=\"password\", # Your database password\n",
    "        database=\"mydb\"      # Your database name\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a cursor object\n",
    "    cursor = db_connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # SQL query\n",
    "    sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM employees\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Execute the query using the cursor\n",
    "    cursor.execute(sql_query)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Fetch all rows from the result set\n",
    "    result_set = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Loop through the result set and print each row\n",
    "    for row in result_set:\n",
    "        print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Close the cursor and the database connection\n",
    "    cursor.close()\n",
    "    db_connection.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> Explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Import the mysql.connector library.\n",
    "    * Use the mysql.connector.connect() method to establish a connection to the MySQL database. Replace the placeholders \n",
    "      (host, user, password, database) with your actual database information.\n",
    "    * Create a cursor object using the cursor() method of the database connection. The cursor is used to execute SQL queries \n",
    "      and fetch results.\n",
    "    * Define an SQL query using the sql_query variable. In this example, the query retrieves all rows from a table named\n",
    "      \"employees.\"\n",
    "    * Use the execute() method of the cursor to execute the SQL query. \n",
    "    * Use the fetchall() method to retrieve all rows from the result set.\n",
    "    * Iterate through the result set using a loop and print each row.\n",
    "    * After you're done using the cursor, close it using the close() method.\n",
    "    * Finally, close the database connection using the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The cursor() method creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries and retrieve results. The execute() \n",
    "    method is used to execute SQL queries using the cursor. It takes the SQL query as an argument and sends it to the database \n",
    "    for execution. The results, if any, can be fetched using methods like fetchone(), fetchall(), or fetchmany(), depending on \n",
    "    we needs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 7:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query generally follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. FROM Clause: The FROM clause specifies the source table(s) from which data is retrieved. This is the starting point of \n",
    "       the query and identifies the table(s) to be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. JOIN Clause: If there are any JOIN clauses in the query, they are executed next. JOIN operations are used to combine data\n",
    "       from multiple tables based on specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. WHERE Clause: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions. It is applied after the JOIN \n",
    "       operations and before any grouping or ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. GROUP BY Clause: If a GROUP BY clause is present, the results are grouped based on the specified columns. Aggregate \n",
    "       functions can be applied to each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. HAVING Clause: The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY based on aggregate function results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. SELECT Clause: The SELECT clause specifies which columns to retrieve from the results. It is applied after filtering, \n",
    "       grouping, and aggregating.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. ORDER BY Clause: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results based on specified columns. It is applied after all other\n",
    "       clauses have been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. LIMIT / OFFSET Clause: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, if used, control the number of rows returned and the starting point \n",
    "       for the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and the order of execution may vary based on \n",
    "    the specific query and its components. Additionally, some databases might optimize the execution order for performance \n",
    "    reasons, but conceptually, the steps outlined above describe the logical flow of how SQL queries are typically processed."
