    "    \n",
    "    Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on presenting only the \n",
    "    essential attributes and behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows you to create complex\n",
    "    systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components with well-defined interfaces. Abstraction provides \n",
    "    a clear separation between what an object does and how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In OOP, abstraction is achieved through classes and their methods. A class defines the blueprint for creating objects,\n",
    "    and its methods define the behaviors that those objects can exhibit. By abstracting away the internal implementation \n",
    "    details of these methods, users of the class can interact with objects based on their public interfaces without \n",
    "    needing to understand the inner workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example to illustrate abstraction:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Vehicle:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "            self.brand = brand\n",
    "            self.model = model\n",

    "\n",
    "    class Motorcycle(Vehicle):\n",
    "        def start_engine(self):\n",
    "            return f\"{self.brand} {self.model} motorcycle engine started.\"\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that are often used \n",
    "    together but serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction:\n",
    "  * Abstraction focuses on showing only the relevant features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "  * It defines the interface of an object, specifying what an object does without specifying how it does it.\n",
    "  * Abstraction allows you to create higher-level concepts that represent real-world entities, with their essential \n",
    "    attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "  * It helps in managing complexity by breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example of Abstraction:\n",
    "    Consider a Shape class with subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Each subclass has methods like \n",
    "    calculate_area and calculate_perimeter. The abstract concept here is the shape's area and perimeter, which can be \n",
    "    calculated differently for different shapes. Users of these classes interact with them using the common methods\n",
    "    without needing to know the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Encapsulation:\n",
    "  * Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a \n",
    "    single unit, called a class.\n",
    "  * It helps in protecting the internal state of an object from unauthorized access and modification by enforcing access\n",
    "    control through public, private, and protected access modifiers.\n",
    "  * Encapsulation ensures that an object's internal representation is hidden, and interactions with the object occur only\n",
    "    through its defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example of Encapsulation:\n",
    "    Consider a BankAccount class with attributes like account_number, balance, and methods like deposit and withdraw. \n",
    "    The attributes are typically marked as private (using naming conventions or access modifiers) to prevent direct \n",
    "    access and modification. Users of the class interact with it using the methods provided, ensuring that the account's\n",
    "    state is maintained correctly and securely.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides tools to create abstract base classes, which\n",
    "    are classes that are meant to serve as templates or blueprints for other classes. Abstract base classes define a \n",
    "    common interface that subclasses should adhere to. They help enforce a specific structure or behavior in subclasses,\n",
    "    promoting code consistency and making it easier to understand and maintain complex class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstract base classes are used to define a common set of methods that should be implemented by all the subclasses, \n",
    "    while also allowing some methods to remain unimplemented (abstract methods). Subclasses that inherit from an abstract\n",
    "    base class are required to provide implementations for these abstract methods, ensuring that the intended behavior is\n",
    "    consistent across all subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The abc module provides the ABC class, which serves as the base class for defining abstract base classes. It also \n",
    "    provides the abstractmethod decorator to mark methods as abstract within abstract base classes. Attempting to create\n",
    "    an instance of a class that inherits from an abstract base class without implementing all the required abstract\n",
    "    methods will result in an error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 4:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Data abstraction in object-oriented programming refers to the concept of hiding the underlying implementation details\n",
    "    of data and only exposing the necessary and relevant information to the outside world. It's a way to represent \n",
    "    complex data structures in a simplified manner. In Python, you can achieve data abstraction using classes and their\n",
    "    methods. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Create a Class:\n",
    "    Define a class that represents the abstract data type. This class should encapsulate the data and provide methods to\n",
    "    interact with it. By defining the interface (methods) that users of the class can interact with, you abstract away \n",
    "    the internal data representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Use Access Modifiers:\n",
    "    Use access modifiers like public, private, and protected to control the visibility of class attributes and methods. \n",
    "    This helps in enforcing data encapsulation, ensuring that the internal state is not directly accessible or modified\n",
    "    from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Provide Methods for Interaction:\n",
    "    Define methods in the class that allow users to perform operations on the data. These methods should encapsulate the\n",
    "    internal logic and provide a controlled way to access or modify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's a simple example to illustrate data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class BankAccount:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "            self._account_number = account_number\n",
    "            self._balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "        def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "            if amount > 0:\n",
    "                self._balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "        def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "            if 0 < amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "                self._balance -= amount\n",
    "\n",
    "        def get_balance(self):\n",
    "            return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    account = BankAccount(\"1234567890\", 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "    account.deposit(500)\n",
    "    account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Account balance:\", account.get_balance())  # Output: Account balance: 1300\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 5:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. Abstract classes are meant to serve as templates or\n",
    "    blueprints for other classes, and they often include abstract methods that are meant to be overridden by their \n",
    "    subclasses. Since abstract methods don't have implementations in the abstract class, it doesn't make sense to create \n",
    "    objects of the abstract class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An abstract class is defined using the abc module's ABC class (or by defining a method with the @abstractmethod \n",
    "    decorator) and is meant to be subclassed. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide implementations \n",
    "    for all the abstract methods defined in the parent abstract class. This enforces a certain structure and behavior in\n",
    "    the subclasses, ensuring that the intended functionality is consistent across different subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Attempting to create an instance of an abstract class will result in a TypeError. Instead, you should create \n",
    "    instances of the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class and implement the required abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's a brief example to demonstrate this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
