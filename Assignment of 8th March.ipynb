    "Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of observing different outcomes in a random experiment or process. There are many types of probability distributions, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here are some of the main types of probability distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: Models a single trial with two possible outcomes (success or failure), often used for binary events.\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "Continuous Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): One of the most widely used distributions, characterized by a bell-shaped curve with symmetrical tails. Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution due to the central limit theorem.\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely within a specified range, resulting in a rectangular-shaped distribution.\n",
    "Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process, such as the time between arrivals of customers at a service counter.\n",
    "Gamma Distribution: Generalization of the exponential distribution, often used to model waiting times or durations until an event occurs.\n",
    "Beta Distribution: Used to model random variables that represent proportions or probabilities, such as the success rate of a product or the probability of an event occurring.\n",
    "Multivariate Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Distribution: Generalization of the binomial distribution to more than two categories.\n",
    "Multivariate Normal Distribution: Generalization of the normal distribution to multiple dimensions, used to model correlated random variables.\n",
    "Other Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Distribution: Models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "Hypergeometric Distribution: Models the number of successes in a sample drawn without replacement from a finite population of two types of items.\n",
    "Negative Binomial Distribution: Generalization of the geometric distribution, models the number of failures before a specified number of successes occurs.\n",

    "The binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution are both probability distributions used to model the number of events occurring within a fixed interval or a fixed number of trials.

    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes (or failures) in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",

    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution is defined for a fixed number of independent trials, denoted as n.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution does not involve a fixed number of trials. It models events occurring over a continuous interval, such as time or space.\n",

    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: In the binomial distribution, the probability of success, denoted as p, remains constant across all trials.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: In the Poisson distribution, the rate parameter λ represents the average rate of occurrence of events within the interval. It is the mean and variance of the distribution.\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution assumes that the trials are independent, and the probability of success is constant across all trials.\n",

    "Applicability:\n",

    "In a normal distribution, the least frequent data points appear farthest from the mean. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, the least frequent data points are located in the tails of the distribution, farthest from the center.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (σ) of the mean.\n",
    "Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations (2σ) of the mean.\n",
    "Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations (3σ) of the mean.\n",
    "Beyond three standard deviations from the mean, the data points become increasingly rare.\n",
