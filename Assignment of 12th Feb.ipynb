    "Answer 1:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the\n",
    "    program's instructions. It is an error that occurs at runtime. When an exception occurs, the program execution is halted,\n",
    "    and Python generates an exception object, which contains information about the type of exception and where it occurred in\n",
    "    the code. You can handle exceptions using try and except blocks to gracefully handle errors and prevent program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of how exceptions work in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "        result = 10 / num\n",
    "        print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the try block contains code that might raise exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block,\n",
    "    it is caught by the corresponding except block, and the program continues to run without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, let's discuss the difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Exceptions:\n",
    "    * Exceptions occur at runtime when an unforeseen situation arises, such as division by zero, invalid data types, file not\n",
    "      found, etc.\n",
    "    * They are not detected by the Python interpreter until the program is executed and reaches the problematic code.\n",
    "    * Exceptions are handled using try and except blocks to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes.\n",
    "    * Examples of exceptions: ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Syntax Errors:\n",
    "    * Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the parsing phase, before the code is executed.\n",
    "    * They are caused by incorrect syntax in the code, such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, invalid variable names,\n",
    "      etc.\n",
    "    * Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running, so the program won't execute \n",
    "      until these errors are fixed.\n",
    "    * Examples of syntax errors: Missing colons in a function definition, incorrect indentation in a code block, misspelled \n",
    "      keywords, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 2:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When an exception is not handled in a program, it leads to what's known as an \"unhandled exception.\" An unhandled exception\n",
    "    occurs when an error occurs at runtime and no code is in place to catch and handle that error using a try and except block.\n",
    "    As a result, the program's normal execution flow is abruptly halted, and an error message is displayed to the user. If the \n",
    "    exception propagates up the call stack without being caught, it can ultimately lead to the termination of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def divide(a, b):\n",
    "        return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "    num1 = 10\n",
    "    num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = divide(num1, num2)\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    print(\"Program continues after division.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the divide function attempts to perform division between num1 and num2. However, since num2 is set to 0, \n",
    "    a ZeroDivisionError exception is raised when attempting to perform the division.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When this exception is raised and not caught by an appropriate try and except block, the following occurs:\n",
    "    * The program execution is immediately halted.\n",
    "    * An error message is displayed indicating the type of exception and a traceback that shows where the exception occurred in the code.\n",
    "    * The program terminates, and any subsequent code that was supposed to execute after the exception won't run.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "       \n",
    "Answer 3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Python, you can catch and handle exceptions using the try and except statements. The try statement is used to enclose \n",
    "    the code that might raise an exception, and the except statement is used to specify the block of code that should be \n",
    "    executed if an exception of a specific type occurs within the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's the basic syntax of using try and except:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here's an example to demonstrate how to catch and handle exceptions using try and except:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def divide(a, b):\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            result = a / b\n",
    "            return result\n",
    "        except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "            print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "            return None\n",
    "\n",
    "    num1 = 10\n",
    "    num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = divide(num1, num2)\n",
    "    if result is not None:\n",
    "        print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    print(\"Program continues after division.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the divide function attempts to perform division between num1 and num2. However, since num2 is set to 0,\n",
    "    a ZeroDivisionError exception is raised when attempting to perform the division.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Answer 4:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. try, else:\n",
    "    The else block in a try and except structure is used to define a block of code that should be executed if no exceptions\n",
    "    occur within the try block. It's optional and is executed only if no exceptions are raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "        result = 10 / num\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    b. finally:\n",
    "    The finally block is used to define a block of code that is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "    It's often used for cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Content:\", content)\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        if 'file' in locals():\n",

    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "    c. raise:\n",
    "    The raise statement is used to raise an exception in your code explicitly. You can use it to trigger exceptions when \n",
    "    certain conditions are met, allowing you to create custom exceptions or handle situations that don't match built-in \n",
    "    exception types.\n",

    "        elif age < 18:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Must be at least 18 years old.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Age is valid.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        user_age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",

    "Answer 5:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you create in Python to handle specific \n",
    "    error conditions in your code. While Python provides a variety of built-in exception types (like ValueError, TypeError,\n",
    "    etc.), there are situations where these may not accurately represent the nature of the error you're encountering. In such \n",
    "    cases, you can define your own exception classes to better communicate the type of error and provide more context to \n",
    "    developers who use or maintain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's why custom exceptions can be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Clarity and Readability: Custom exceptions make your code more readable and self-explanatory. They provide clear\n",
    "       information about the error condition and its context, helping other developers understand the purpose of the exception\n",
    "       without having to dive deep into the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Consistency: By creating custom exceptions, you can ensure that error handling in your code follows a consistent \n",
    "        pattern. This improves maintainability and reduces the chances of errors slipping through the cracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Modularity: Custom exceptions allow you to encapsulate error-related logic within the exception class itself. This\n",
    "         modular approach makes your code more organized and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv. Custom Error Handling: You can design custom exception classes with specific behavior for error handling, such as \n",
    "        providing additional information, logging, or triggering specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of creating and using a custom exception:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Exception raised for insufficient funds in an account.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",

    "            self.balance = balance\n",
    "            self.amount = amount\n",
    "            super().__init__(f\"Insufficient funds: balance={balance}, amount={amount}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(balance, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > balance:\n",
    "            raise InsufficientFundsError(balance, amount)\n",
    "        return balance - amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        account_balance = 1000\n",
    "        withdrawal_amount = 1500\n",
    "        new_balance = withdraw(account_balance, withdrawal_amount)\n",
